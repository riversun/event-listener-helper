[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/riversun/event-listener-helper/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/riversun/event-listener-helper)

  This library allows you to:
  get a list of event listeners attached to the target node,
  confirms the existence of event listener registered on the target node,
  deletes all event listeners registered on the target node,
  registers event listeners with name (rather than a reference).
  These benefits can be received by calling addEventListener and removeEventListener through this library.
